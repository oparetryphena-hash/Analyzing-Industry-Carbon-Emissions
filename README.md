## 📘 Overview

This project analyzes product-level carbon emissions (Product Carbon Footprints – PCFs) across industries using PostgreSQL. The goal is to understand which industries, companies, and countries contribute most to global emissions — and how emissions differ by product and production stage.

The dataset comes from **The Carbon Catalogue** (Nature.com), which provides verified greenhouse gas emissions data for various consumer and industrial products.
